# A2C OpenAi Gym Environment
The goal of the project was to help you understand the concept of policy gradient algorithms and to allow you to implement the actor-critic algorithm and apply it to solve OpenAI gym environments. We have trained our networks on a reinforcement learning environment among OpenAI Gym or other complex environments.

We have experimented with three environments in total:
1. Grid World Environment
2. CartPole-v1
3. Acrobot-v1

For all three environments we have tried solving them using `Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)` algorithm. We have documented the whole project with the results in the `Report.pdf` file represent in the repository.
